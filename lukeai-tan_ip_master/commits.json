Task class","messageBody":"Task contains a String description and a boolean isDone.\nIt has a constructor that takes in a String description parameter, as well as setting isDone to false by default.\ngetStatusIcon() creates a visual for its \"done\" status.\nsetAsDone() and setAsUndone are setter functions that sets the isDone variable to true and false respectively.\nOverrode the default Object.toString() so that the Task instances displays completion status and task description / name.\nChanged the ArrayList type in RedGirl from String to Task.\n","tags":["A-Classes"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":31,"deletions":4}}},{"hash":"2c6f888d97dfe834a4c30213342f1abe0a791f76","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add convertToRedGirlTheme","messageBody":"Function that converts dialogue text colour into dark red.\nIntention is to reduce redundancy in the print functions when the darkRed and reset strings are added

RedGirl.java","messageBody":"Added redGirlPrint() that uses convertToRedGirlTheme(), which reduces more redundancy in the code when printing each of the bot\u0027s dialogues\n\nAdded handleMarkInput\u0027s functionality\n- It handles edge cases such as wrong number of arguments and invalid index\n- After edge case checks, it marks and unmarks accordingly\n\nModified initRedGirl\u0027s condition for the mark and unmark commands\n- conditions now search for \"mark \" and \"unmark \" with a space behind, ensuring that it is the actual command and not a task named \"marking homework\" or \"marker\"\n","tags":["Level-3"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":45,"deletions":16}}}]},{"date":"2025-08-25T00:00:00","commitResults":[{"hash":"f7170b80c7c5ddc852e990af78991a8bae8591c8","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add
